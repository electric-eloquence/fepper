# kill_zombies will kill lingering Node and Gulp processes. However, if you wish

backend:
  synced_dirs:
    # Relative paths to destination directories for code developed in Fepper.
    # - First, plug a backend into Fepper. Put the actual codebase or even just
    #   a symbolic link to the codebase into the backend directory.
    # - Then, enter the paths relative to the backend directory as destinations
    #   for frontend code to be synced by Fepper.
    # - It is recommended to contain the backend codebase within a docroot
    #   directory just below the backend directory. This is so Fepper can serve
    #   static files from the backend as per the webserved_dirs settings.
    # - Do not include "backend" or a leading slash in the directory settings.
    # - Do not include a leading dot in the templates_ext setting.
    # - Note that JavaScripts will only be synced if they are at least one
    #   directory below patternlab-php/source/js. In other words, place
    #   JavaScripts you wish to ignore directly in patternlab-php/source/js and
    #   no deeper.
    # - Use the node . syncback task to perform the sync.
    #
    # - Examples:
    #css_dir: docroot/themes/theme/css
    #fonts_dir: docroot/themes/theme/fonts
    #images_dir: docroot/themes/theme/images
    #js_dir: docroot/themes/theme/js
    #templates_dir: docroot/themes/theme/templates
    #templates_ext: tpl.php
    css_dir:
    fonts_dir:
    images_dir:
    js_dir:
    templates_dir: docroot/templates
    templates_ext: tpl.php

  webserved_dirs:
    # Relative paths to the backend directories that will be served by Fepper's
    # webserver.
    # - These directories will just be served; no syncing will occur with them
    #   unless they are also listed in synced_dirs. The assets in webserved_dirs
    #   can be browsed (or included) without having to copy them over into
    #   Pattern Lab.
    # - Be sure a backend is plugged into Fepper.
    # - Create a list of relative paths which are to be served. Each path must
    #   contain the document root and the path from the document root to the
    #   target directory.
    # - Do not include "backend" or a leading slash.
    # - To include the directories' assets in your code (or to view them in a
    # - browser), enter the path without the document root. For example, if the
    #   setting is docroot/assets, enter /assets without docroot.
    # - A version-controlled instance of these settings can be set in data.json
    #   under backend_webserved_dirs. Be sure they are entered in array syntax!
    # - The backend_webserved_dirs settings in data.json takes precedence over
    #   these settings in conf.yml.
    # - Assuming a host on the web is serving an instance of the backend, a
    #   GitHub Page of this Fepper instance can access those assets if the
    #   gh_pages_prefix setting is set in data.json and points correctly to that
    #   host.
    # - Do not include a trailing slash in gh_pages_prefix.
    # - Do not use names that will collide with what's in Pattern Lab, i.e.
    #   docroot/images, docroot/css, etc.
    # - DO NOT INCLUDE DIRECTORIES WITH SOURCE CODE! GITHUB PAGES AND MANY OTHER
    #   PUBLIC HOSTS DO NOT PREPROCESS PHP AND OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, SO
    #   ANY PUBLISHED SOURCE CODE WILL BE RENDERED AS PLAIN TEXT! THIS WILL MAKE
    #   PUBLIC ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE SOURCE CODE!
    #
    # - Examples:
    #- docroot/assets
    #- docroot/media
    - docroot/assets

templater:
  # By default, the Templater will not retain untranslated Mustache tags when
  # translating to the backend's templating language. However, if the backend's
  # templating language happens to be Mustache, set this value to true.
  retain_mustache: false

# It is not a good idea to change the following values, but you can comment out
# gh_pages_src and gh_pages_dest to surpress publishing the Fepper public dir to
# GitHub Pages. This may be desired if you only wish to publish a Fepper subsite
# and not the global site.
gh_pages_src: .publish/fepper-gh-pages
gh_pages_dest: .publish/gulp-gh-pages

# If using webserved_dirs and publishing to GitHub Pages, the repository name
# must be prefixed to the src of images and other assets in webserved_dirs. This
# value can also be set in data.json and be saved in version control. If both
# are set, the setting in this file will take priority. Be sure to include the
# leading slash in this setting.
gh_pages_prefix: /github-repository-name
