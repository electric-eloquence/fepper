Put custom JavaScripts in ui/source/_scripts/src. Include these js files at the bottom of ui/source/_patternlab-files/pattern-header-footer/footer.html.

Note: files placed in the top level of ui/source/js will be ignored by `gulp syncback`. In order to sync js files, they must be placed at least one directory beneath ui/source/js.
