# To activate subsites:
# `mkdir ../../custom/fp-multisite`
# `cp default.multisite.yml ../../custom/fp-multisite/multisite.yml`
# Then list them below. Use YAML array of objects syntax.
subsites:
  # Use a hyphen to delimit each subsite object as a separate array element.
  -
    # Make sure the subsite name matches the directory name.
