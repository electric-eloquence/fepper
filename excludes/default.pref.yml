backend:
  synced_dirs:
    # Relative paths to destination directories for code developed in Fepper.
    # - First, plug a backend into Fepper. Put the actual codebase or even just
    #   a symbolic link to the codebase into the /backend directory.
    # - Then, enter the paths relative to the /backend directory as destinations
    #   for frontend code to be synced by Fepper.
    # - It is recommended to contain the backend codebase within a docroot
    #   directory just below the /backend directory. This is so Fepper can serve
    #   static files from the backend as per the webserved_dirs settings.
    # - Do not include "backend" or a leading or trailing slash in the directory
    #   settings.
    # - Do not include a leading dot in the templates_ext setting.
    # - Note that JavaScripts will only be synced if they are at least one
    #   directory below patternlab-php/source/js. In other words, place
    #   JavaScripts you wish to ignore directly in patternlab-php/source/js and
    #   no deeper.
    # - Use the fp syncback task to perform the sync.
    #
    # - Examples:
    #assets_dir: docroot/themes/theme/assets
    #scripts_dir: docroot/themes/theme/scripts
    #styles_dir: docroot/themes/theme/styles
    #templates_dir: docroot/themes/theme/templates
    #templates_ext: tpl.php

  webserved_dirs:
    # Relative paths to the backend directories that will be served by Fepper's
    # webserver.
    # - These directories will just be served; no syncing will occur with them
    #   unless they are also listed in synced_dirs. The files in webserved_dirs
    #   can be browsed (or included) without having to copy them over into
    #   Pattern Lab.
    # - Be sure a backend is plugged into Fepper.
    # - Create a list of relative paths which are to be served. Each path must
    #   contain the document root and the path from the document root to the
    #   target directory.
    # - Do not include "backend" or a leading or trailing slash.
    # - To include the directories' files in your code (or to view them in a
    # - browser), enter the path without the document root. For example, if the
    #   setting is docroot/css, enter /css without docroot.
    # - Do not use names that will collide with what's in Pattern Lab, i.e.
    #   docroot/assets, docroot/scripts, etc.
    # - DO NOT INCLUDE DIRECTORIES WITH SOURCE CODE! GITHUB PAGES AND MANY OTHER
    #   PUBLIC HOSTS DO NOT PREPROCESS PHP AND OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, SO
    #   ANY PUBLISHED SOURCE CODE WILL BE RENDERED AS PLAIN TEXT! THIS WILL MAKE
    #   PUBLIC ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN THE SOURCE CODE!
    #
    # - Examples:
    #- docroot/css
    #- docroot/img
    #- docroot/js

templater:
  # By default, the Templater will not retain untranslated Mustache tags when
  # translating to the backend's templating language. However, if the backend's
  # templating language happens to be Mustache, set this value to true.
  retain_mustache: false

# It is not a good idea to change the following value, but you can comment out
# gh_pages_src to surpress publishing the Fepper public dir to GitHub Pages.
# This may be desired if you only wish to publish a Fepper subsite and not the
# global site.
gh_pages_src: .publish/fepper-gh-pages

# If using webserved_dirs and publishing to GitHub Pages, the repository name
# must be prefixed to the src of the files in webserved_dirs. Do not include a 
# leading or trailing slash.
#gh_pages_prefix: github-repository-name
