Put the actual backend codebase or even just a symbolic link to the codebase
into this directory. Then, enter the relative paths to the appropriate backend
directories into the conf.yml file at the root directory of Fepper. You will
then be able to run `gulp syncback` to export your frontend data into your
backend web application.
