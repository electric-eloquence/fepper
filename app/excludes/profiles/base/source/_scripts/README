Put custom JavaScripts in source/_scripts/src. Include these js files at the bottom of source/_meta/_01-foot.mustache.

Note: files placed in the top level of source/_scripts will be ignored by `fp syncback` and other syncing commands.
In order to sync js files, they must be placed at least one directory beneath source/_scripts.
