Put custom JavaScripts in source/_scripts/src. Include these js files at the 
bottom of source/_meta/_01-foot.mustache.

Note: files placed in the top level of source/_scripts will be ignored by 
`fp frontend-copy` and `fp syncback`. In order to sync js files, they must be 
placed at least one directory beneath source/_scripts.
