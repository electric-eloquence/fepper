Put custom JavaScripts in ui/source/_scripts/src. Include these js files at the bottom of ui/source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_01-foot.mustache.

Note: files placed in the top level of ui/source/js will be ignored by `fp syncback`. In order to sync js files, they must be placed at least one directory beneath ui/source/js.
